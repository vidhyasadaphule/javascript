    Subject: FOR OF VS FOR IN
    Description:
          FOR IN

         1.the difference between for in and for of is for in iterates over the properties of objects 
          but for of iterates over the values of object.
        2.for does not iterate over an object it only iterates over an array.

        #for in iterates over an object
        #for of iterates over an array,maps,set
