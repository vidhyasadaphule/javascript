<script>

    // the function is stored in a variable  so it is also called an first class function.
    var ans = function(){
       console.log('function called here');
    };
    
    ans();

    //anonymous function with parameter

    var res = function(x){
        document.write(`<h2> this is second anonymous function called here! </h2>`,x);
    };
    res ("second");
    
    // self executing anonymous function
    (()=>{
              console.log("self executing function");
    })();

    (()=>{
        console.log("ra");
